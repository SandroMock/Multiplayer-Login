# Multiplayer-Login
Simple Multiplayer Login in Unreal Engine 5.1.1 ( Blueprints )

In this Plugin you can login to a session someone created in your local network. You can join with your own username and everyone can see it.
Change the spawned Character and the follow up level to your own setup and you should be good to go!

Have fun =)
